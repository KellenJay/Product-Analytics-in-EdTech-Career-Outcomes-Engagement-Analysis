# Causal Inference Analysis: Do Projects Lead to More Job Offers?

This repository explores whether completing more projects causally increases studentsâ€™ job offers.  
We apply multiple causal inference frameworks, diagnosing assumptions at each step, and finish with business-ready insights.

## Step 1: DAG Modeling

Constructed a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to formalize assumptions.

- **Treatment (X):** `Projects_Completed`  
- **Outcome (Y):** `Job_Offers`  
- **Confounders (C):** `Internships_Completed`, `Networking_Score`, `Soft_Skills_Score`  

Applied the **backdoor criterion** to confirm identifiability.  
Initial regression suggested a positive effect â€” but regression alone cannot establish causality.  

â†’ Moved to design-based estimators.

## Step 2: Propensity Score Matching (Quartile Split) â†’ Failed

- Treatment defined as **high projects (â‰¥8)** vs **low projects (â‰¤5)**.  
- **Result:** No overlap in propensity scores (controls â‰¤0.11 vs treated â‰¥0.92).  
- After trimming, zero controls remained.  

**Takeaway:** Matching not defensible; highlights why overlap checks are essential.

## Step 3: Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (Median Split) â†’ Partial Success

- Treatment redefined as **high projects (â‰¥6)** vs **low projects (<6)**.  
- Applied stabilized IPTW with trimming.  
- **Diagnostics:** Balance improved but remained poor (SMD â‰ˆ 1.6â€“2.0 >> 0.1).  
- **Estimate:** ATE â‰ˆ +1.68 job offers (p < 0.001, 95% CI [1.51, 1.85]).  

**Caution:** Large effect likely inflated due to residual imbalance.

## Step 4: Overlap Weights (ATO) â†’ Robust & Credible

To focus on the **region of common support**, we applied overlap weights.  

Compared three propensity models:  
- Logistic (baseline): ATO = 0.180, poor balance (max|SMD|=0.55).  
- Polynomial logistic (deg 2): ATO = 0.026, good balance (max|SMD|=0.08).  
- Gradient boosting: ATO = 0.023, excellent balance (max|SMD|=0.02).  

**Result:** Effect shrank to near zero once balance was achieved.

## Step 5: Bayesian Inference â†’ Stability & Trade-offs

Fit a Bayesian Negative Binomial regression (with confounder adjustment).  
Reported **posterior rate ratios** instead of point estimates.  

**Findings:**  
- Naive (unadjusted) models overstated the effect (RR > 2.5).  
- Adjusted models centered near 1.0 with wide credible intervals â†’ no clear causal effect.  
- Prior sensitivity (narrow, baseline, wide) produced nearly identical posteriors â†’ results are **data-driven, not prior-driven**.

## Trade-offs and Lessons

- **PSM:** Simple and intuitive, but requires strong overlap. Failed in our data.  
- **IPTW:** Easy to interpret, but unstable under poor overlap (overstated effects).  
- **Overlap Weights:** Robust to limited overlap; revealed null effect but applies only to overlap population.  
- **Bayesian GLM:** Provided richer uncertainty quantification and showed robustness to prior choice.

## Final Conclusion

Naive models suggested projects strongly increase job offers.  
But once confounders (internships, networking, soft skills) were properly addressed:

- **Overlap weights** and **Bayesian inference** converged on a **null effect** (RR â‰ˆ 1.0, credible intervals crossing 1.0).  
- **Interpretation:** Project completion alone does **not** drive job offers; its apparent effect is confounded by internships and networking.

## Recommendations for the Business

1. **Donâ€™t over-invest in project count alone.** More projects are not sufficient to improve job outcomes.  
2. **Strengthen internships and networking opportunities.** These confounders explained most of the apparent project effect.  
3. **Promote holistic career readiness.** Balance project-based learning with soft skills and professional connections.  
4. **Use causal inference in product analytics.** Diagnosing overlap, balance, and robustness prevents overconfident conclusions from naive models.
